# Data Description

1. Processed data
There are two versions of preprocessed data generated.
Data files with the gene filtering process has suffix "_dat.RData".
Data files without the gene filtering process has suffix "_dat_raw.RData"
For datasets involved in Sim1 and Variance Analysis (GSE113590, GSE51984, GSE60424, GSE64655), we created "_dat_raw.RData", since all analysis is restricted to the same dataset.
For datasets involved in Sim2 and Sim3 (GSE51984, GSE60424, GSE64655, GSE115736, GSE118490), we created "_dat.RData", since the filtering process will be performed after data concatenation.
Thus, for datasets that involved in both groups (Sim1, Sim2 and Sim3), we created two versions of preprocessed data.
You can either process data from Raw quantification data or directly load processed data.
We recommend users to uncompress Processed data under the ./data folder to avoid path parameter reassignment of scripts under ./code/varStructure/

2. Params Data
Params data contain basic settings of each simulation framework such as datasets, cellular component, factors, units and gene index (Details are in the Supplementary Table 3 of the publication)
3 sets of params are created for 3 simulation frameworks: Sim1, Sim2 and Sim3.
You can either create "SimX"_params.RData from "SimX"_params_set.R scripts.
Or you can directly load "SimX"_params.RData under ./data folder.

3. Reference Data
Reference data contains reference used for deconvolution analysis.
Type of reference objects include: reference profile, averaged reference profile, signature gene sets, marker gene sets and reference sample annotation.
You can either create reference data from "SimX"_refGenerator.R scripts.
Or you can directly load "SimX"_ref.RData under ./data folder.

4. Weight Data
Cellular component proportion data from 3 simulated frameworks.
All data are stored under ./data folder.
Sim1_W.txt, 

5. Mix Data
In silico mixture data of 3 simulated frameworks.
You can either create mixture data from "SimX"_mix.R scripts.
Or you can directly load "SimX"_mix.RData under ./data folder.

6. Deconvolution Estimation Data
Estimation results of deconvolution analysis. 

7. Evaluation Data
Evaluation of deconvolution estimations based on two evaluation metrics: correlation and mAD. 

8. Other Data
sim1_diagnostics_simModel.RData are variance analysis for Sim1_simModel.
You can either generate this dat from "sim1_diagnostics_simModel.R"
Or you can directly load the data under ./data/ folder.
